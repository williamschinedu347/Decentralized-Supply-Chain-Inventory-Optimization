# Decentralized Supply Chain Inventory Optimization

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform enables end-to-end supply chain inventory optimization through decentralized consensus mechanisms. By leveraging smart contracts and distributed ledger technology, the system provides real-time inventory visibility, automated replenishment, and data-driven forecasting while maintaining trust between supply chain participants without requiring a central authority.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to create a comprehensive inventory optimization ecosystem:

1. **Entity Verification Contract**: Validates and authenticates supply chain participants
2. **Inventory Tracking Contract**: Maintains accurate, real-time stock level records
3. **Demand Forecasting Contract**: Utilizes historical data to predict future inventory requirements
4. **Replenishment Contract**: Automates reordering processes based on forecasts and policies
5. **Performance Analytics Contract**: Measures and analyzes inventory efficiency metrics

## Smart Contracts

### Entity Verification Contract

This contract authenticates and manages all participants in the supply chain network.

**Key Features:**
- Onboarding and verification of manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and logistics providers
- Role-based access control for different supply chain functions
- Digital identity management with appropriate credentials
- Trust rating system based on historical performance
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

### Inventory Tracking Contract

This contract maintains a single source of truth for inventory levels across the supply chain.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time inventory tracking with SKU-level granularity
- Automated updates through IoT device integration
- Product serialization and batch tracking
- Inventory movement and transfer documentation
- Location tracking for goods in transit
- Expiration date management for perishable goods

### Demand Forecasting Contract

This contract leverages historical data and machine learning to predict future inventory requirements.

**Key Features:**
- Time-series analysis of historical demand patterns
- Seasonal trend identification and adjustment
- External factor correlation (promotions, weather, events)
- Collaborative forecasting from multiple supply chain participants
- Confidence interval calculations for predictions
- Forecast accuracy tracking and continuous improvement

### Replenishment Contract

This contract automates the inventory replenishment process based on forecasts and policies.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic reorder point and safety stock calculations
- Automated purchase order generation
- Supplier selection optimization based on performance and terms
- Smart order routing to minimize costs or delivery time
- Order consolidation for transportation efficiency
- Exception handling for non-standard situations

### Performance Analytics Contract

This contract measures and analyzes inventory efficiency across the supply chain.

**Key Features:**
- Key performance indicator (KPI) tracking for inventory metrics
- Inventory turnover rate calculation
- Stockout frequency and duration analysis
- Working capital optimization insights
- Carrying cost calculations and trend analysis
- Benchmark comparisons against industry standards

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- Access to Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, or other enterprise blockchain
- Web3 provider or equivalent blockchain connector
- Solidity compiler (^0.8.0)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/decentralized-inventory-optimization.git
   cd decentralized-inventory-optimization
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
   or
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to blockchain network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```
   or
   ```
   truffle migrate --network <your-network>
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file with your configuration variables:
   ```
   BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_URL=your_node_url
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployment_wallet_private_key
   IPFS_NODE=your_ipfs_node_for_extended_data_storage
   ```

2. Configure the network settings in your deployment configuration file.

## Usage

### Entity Registration and Verification

Supply chain participants must register and be verified before joining the network.

```javascript
// Example entity registration
await EntityVerificationContract.registerEntity(
  entityID,
  entityType, // manufacturer, distributor, retailer, logistics
  businessCredentials,
  locationData,
  contactInformation
);
```

### Inventory Level Reporting

Participants report inventory levels, which are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

```javascript
// Example inventory update
await InventoryTrackingContract.updateInventoryLevel(
  entityID,
  productID,
  locationID,
  quantityChange, // positive for additions, negative for removals
  batchID,
  expirationDate,
  transactionType
);
```

### Demand Forecast Generation

The system generates demand forecasts based on historical data and external factors.

```javascript
// Example forecast generation
await DemandForecastingContract.generateForecast(
  productID,
  locationID,
  forecastPeriod,
  confidenceLevel,
  externalFactors // optional array of events, promotions, etc.
);
```

### Automated Replenishment

The system initiates replenishment orders based on forecasts and inventory policies.

```javascript
// Example replenishment order
await ReplenishmentContract.initiateReplenishment(
  buyerEntityID,
  productID,
  quantity,
  requiredByDate,
  supplierPreferences // optional
);
```

### Performance Analytics

Supply chain participants can analyze inventory performance metrics.

```javascript
// Example performance analysis
const performanceMetrics = await PerformanceAnalyticsContract.getInventoryMetrics(
  entityID,
  productID,
  startDate,
  endDate,
  metricTypes // array of requested metrics
);
```
